# Serializability

**Serializability** is a key property of blockchains, and a well-defined property in
standard databases that can be accepted when certain guarantees are more important
than raw throughput. The process of consensus and creating an ordered block of
transactions provides the basis for this guarantee. If the state machine then
executes them sequentially, we have the _serializable_ property, because we actually
execute them serially.

However, in a multi-chain (IBC) system, we have to be careful about how we implement this,
as the state transitions in the receiving chain are no longer atomic with the state transitions
on the sending chain, and we no longer have a guarantee of sequential order. Also, if there
are attempts to speed up performance by optimistically executing transactions in parallel,
the designer must be very careful of this implementation and understand the concept
of _serializability_ very well to avoid unexpected behavior.

## In ACID Databases

Let's start with a more practical definition, as a user of a system that supports this.
The **I** in ACID-compliant database stands for **Isolation**. PostgreSQL has a solid
implementation of this, and defines the concept of "Transaction Isolation", which you
may well have encountered and used:

> The SQL standard defines four levels of transaction isolation. The most strict is Serializable, which is defined by the standard in a paragraph which says that any concurrent execution of a set of Serializable transactions is guaranteed to produce the same effect as running them one at a time in some order. The other three levels are defined in terms of phenomena, resulting from interaction between concurrent transactions, which must not occur at each level. The standard notes that due to the definition of Serializable, none of these phenomena are possible at that level.

([PostgreSQL docs: Transaction Isolation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html))

It goes on and explains

> The _Serializable_ isolation level provides the strictest transaction isolation. This level emulates serial transaction execution for all committed transactions; as if transactions had been executed one after another, serially, rather than concurrently. However, like the Repeatable Read level, applications using this level must be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures. In fact, this isolation level works exactly the same as Repeatable Read except that it also monitors for conditions which could make execution of a concurrent set of serializable transactions behave in a manner inconsistent with all possible serial (one at a time) executions of those transactions. This monitoring does not introduce any blocking beyond that present in repeatable read, but there is some overhead to the monitoring, and detection of the conditions which could cause a _serialization anomaly_ will trigger a _serialization failure_.

Continuing with an example of [such a case that you can read](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html#XACT-SERIALIZABLE).

The key point here is that, in the interest of performance, the database _does not_ actually run them
serially, not use locking to ensure key portions are run serially. Instead, it detects any conflict, and
if present, aborts the transaction with an error (to be retried later). Such a definition may be useful
when speeding up local changes, but it is not possible when the transaction consists of sub-transactions on different blockchains, as we cannot roll them both back on failure.

Example: I start (but don't commit) a transaction on chain A, and send a message to chain B.
Chain B starts a transaction, which succeeds. While committing on chain A, I detect a conflict
and abort it (roll it back). However, I can no longer safely roll back the state on B. If you attempt
to add more phases, you end up with a game of ping-pong, where one chain is unable to rollback
if the other fails.

## General Approaches

In distributed systems, we need to be more careful, and go back to the general definition of
Serialiazable systems, to determine which primitives we need to implement it. And from there
determine which technique will be most effective in our system. Let's start with
[Wikipedia (which has quite good references in computer science)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability#View_and_conflict_serializability). (All quotes below are from this page, unless otherwise noted)

### Locking Data

> Operations upon data are _read_ or _write_ (a write: insert, update, or delete). Two operations are conflicting if they are of different transactions, upon the same datum (data item), and at least one of them is write. Each such pair of conflicting operations has a conflict type: it is either a read–write, or write–read, or a write–write conflict. The transaction of the second operation in the pair is said to be in conflict with the transaction of the first operation.

So far, we can start thinking of Read-Write Locks to avoid said conflicts.
[Two-Phase Locking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_locking) explains how to handle
this approach without deadlocks, and would be the first approach we could consider. In fact,
I would consider it the simplest general-case solution to the problem, without understanding
the details of the actual transactions being executed.

### Commutative Operations

> A more general definition of conflicting operations (also for complex operations, which may each consist of several "simple" read/write operations) requires that they are noncommutative (changing their order also changes their combined result). Each such operation needs to be atomic by itself (using proper system support) in order to be considered an operation for a commutativity check. For example, read–read operations are commutative (unlike read–write and the other possibilities) and thus read–read is not a conflict. Another more complex example: the operations increment and decrement of a counter are both write operations (both modify the counter), but do not need to be considered conflicting (write-write conflict type) since they are commutative (thus increment–decrement is not a conflict; e.g., already has been supported in the old IBM's IMS "fast path").

The idea of "commutative operations" gets very attractive for our case. In this case, we need no
locks, or special handling of the packet and ACK ordering. One way to guarantee commutativity
is to create a [data structure that is a CRDT](#crdts) (link to section below). Often that is
not possible (we have some global invariants that may never be broken), and we need to
look further. But if it is possible to use CRDTs, you can always guarantee serializability, without
the need for locks or any other bookkeeping.

Note that Incrementing and Decrementing a counter is a good example of a commutative operation,
but once we start adding some global invariants, like "counter must never go below 0", this is
no longer commutative. `+10`, `-5` would equal `5`, while `-5`, `+10` would error on the first
operation and leave the counter at `10` after the second operation.

### Operation Ordering

> Only precedence (time order) in pairs of conflicting (non-commutative) operations is important when checking equivalence to a serial schedule, since different schedules consisting of the same transactions can be transformed from one to another by changing orders between different transactions' operations (different transactions' interleaving), and since changing orders of commutative operations (non-conflicting) does not change an overall operation sequence result, i.e., a schedule outcome (the outcome is preserved through order change between non-conflicting operations, but typically not when conflicting operations change order). This means that if a schedule can be transformed to any serial schedule without changing orders of conflicting operations (but changing orders of non-conflicting, while preserving operation order inside each transaction), then the outcome of both schedules is the same, and the schedule is conflict-serializable by definition.

Note that the ordering described here refers to not just the order of starting the individual
transactions, but the order of **committing** them. That is, if A, B, and C all decrement a counter
by 1, which starts at 2, then one will fail. We need to commit A and B before C to ensure that
C will fail if we wish to maintain the serializability property. Technically, the commit
doesn't happen until the response from the remote chain, but we need to enforce such
invariants on the sending chain before we send the IBC packet.

Furthermore, this suggests that by inspecting the actual contents of the transactions,
we can determine exactly which sections could conflict and design an algorithm to only focus
on ensuring those sections are executed serially. This allows the rest of the transactional logic
to be processed normally and limits the number of locks we need to take.

### Distributed Serializability and Atomic Commit

Most of the above discussion has been focused on the concurrent processing on one machine,
where the transactions are processed in parallel, but atomic commits are (usually) granted by
shared memory. However, in a distributed system, we need to consider the actual
process of committing.

> Distributed serializability is the serializability of a schedule of a transactional distributed system (e.g., a distributed database system). Such a system is characterized by distributed transactions (also called global transactions), i.e., transactions that span computer processes (a process abstraction in a general sense, depending on computing environment; e.g., operating system's thread) and possibly network nodes. A distributed transaction comprises more than one of several local sub-transactions that each has states as described above for a database transaction. A local sub-transaction comprises a single process, or more processes that typically fail together (e.g., in a single processor core). Distributed transactions imply a need for an atomic commit protocol to reach consensus among its local sub-transactions on whether to commit or abort. Such protocols can vary from a simple (one-phase) handshake among processes that fail together to more sophisticated protocols, like two-phase commit, to handle more complicated cases of failure (e.g., process, node, communication, etc. failure)

(From [Wikipedia - Distributed Serializability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability#Distributed_serializability))

A [Two-Phase Commit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol) requires
significant communication between the nodes, and is not suitable for an IBC system.
For our purpose, we can look at the basic requirements of
[Atomic Commits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit):

> In the field of computer science, an atomic commit is an operation that applies a set of distinct changes as a single operation. If the changes are applied, then the atomic commit is said to have succeeded. If there is a failure before the atomic commit can be completed, then all the changes completed in the atomic commit are reversed. This ensures that the system is always left in a consistent state

This can be implemented in a two-chain IBC protocol with the following approach:

1. The sending chain A completes its sub-transaction and maintains all needed locks
   (or other structs) to guarantee it can commit or rollback the state transitions as needed.
2. The receiving chain B processes its sub-transaction and returns a success or error ACK.
3. If the ACK is a success, chain A commits its state transitions. If it is an error, chain A
   rolls back its state transitions.

This builds on the existing IBC infrastructure and is the reason why ACKs were introduced
into the IBC protocol in the first place.

**Important**: The key item we must guarantee is **processing an ACK must never fail**.
That also means, no conflicts and no possibility of violating invariants.
Whatever approach we take to enforce this, we must prove that for any possible set of transactions that occurs
between the sending of the IBC packet and receiving the ACK or Timeout, that the ACK will
always be processed successfully. Any transaction that _may_ cause this condition to be violated _must_
be rejected (return an error).

## CRDTs

CRDTs are "magical" beasts. Since they are fully commutative, there is no more concern about ordering or conflicts.
If we can express our data in terms of commutative operations and a manifested state of them, this allows unordered channels
without any more concerns about data consistency.

> **Commutative** replicated data types (`CmRDTs`) replicas propagate state by transmitting only the update operation. For example, a CmRDT of a single
> integer might broadcast the operations (+10) or (−20). Replicas receive the updates and apply them locally. The operations are commutative. However, they are
> not necessarily idempotent. The communications infrastructure must therefore ensure that all operations on a replica are delivered to the other replicas,
> without duplication, but in any order.

(From [Wikipedia - CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#Known_CRDTs))

The key point here is every operation is commutative. This works great for a counter (increment and decrement) **over all integer values**.
However, if we could ever hit a limit (`i64::MAX` or simply `0`), then one of the operations would fail. And the particular operation
that fails depends on the ordering of the operations, thus rendering it no longer commutative. If the limits are `i128::MAX` and `i128::MIN`
and there is a limit to the value of the counter (not user defined), then we can prove we will never hit the said limits and this
would be commutative. However, since we usually enforce `value > 0` on blockchains, this would rarely work.

Other types that are well-defined and may be useful to IBC protocols are "grow-only set", "two-phase-set" (once removed, it can never enter),
"last write wins" (based on some trusted timestamp). These are mathematical definitions and can be implemented in a variety of ways.
For example "grow-only set" could be an "append-only vector" where we keep it sorted and remove duplicates.

You can read more on some [standard defined CRDT types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#Known_CRDTs).

## Locking

CRDTs are extremely flexible and resilient, but it is very difficult to map most business logic to such types.
On the opposite extreme, we can use locking to ensure that only one transaction is processed at a time. This is limiting,
but it is provably correct over any business logic.

Note that commit ordering is essential here. If we start transaction A, B, C on the sending chain
concurrently, we still want to treat them as if they were committed in order. That all of A's processing is done
before B starts. If they are completely independent and don't touch the same data, then they can safely run concurrently.
If they depend on (or would interfere with) each other, then we must fail the later transactions before sending an IBC packet.
It can be retried after A is committed, and we can safely determine the result.

Note this extends both to the order of processing of A', B', C' on the receiving chain, and the order of ACKs
arriving at the sending chain. On top of this, we have to ensure that no other transactions conflict with any open
IBC transactions. Transaction A is "open" from the time the first logic is run on the sending chain (which will send
the IBC message) until the ACK is fully processed and committed on the sending chain. This will span several blocks,
possibly hours in the case of timeouts.

We can model this with [Two-phase locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_locking#Two-phase_locking_and_its_special_cases)
, which defines a "growing phase" of acquiring locks, followed by a "shrinking phase" of releasing locks. This is done to be
resistant to deadlock. We would do the following:

1. Start Tx on Sending Chain: Acquire all read/write locks on all data that will be touched. This is the "growing" phase of the lock.
2. Process Packet on Receiving Chain: Acquire all read/write locks on all data, process data, release all locks. This goes from the "growing" phase to the "shrinking" phase.
3. Process ACK on the Sending Chain: Process ACK, and release all locks. This is the "shrinking" phase.

Note that blockchains actually process all transactions sequentially (this is one of their main purposes), so we can simplify this
by considering any non-IBC transaction to get and release locks on all data it touches during its execution.
Furthermore, if we read all data in phase 1, and don't read it later, there is no possibility that a later transaction can
cause a conflict, so we can release all read locks at the end of the "growing" phase. However,
_data read during Phase 3 will need a read lock from Phase 1_

With that, we can simplify to:

1. Start Tx on Sending Chain: Acquire all locks on all data that may be touched in Phase 3, but don't write anything.
2. Process Packet on Receiving Chain: Process data, and return success or error ACK.
3. Process ACK on the Sending Chain: Commit or rollback based on ACK. Only can read/write data held under lock from step 1

If we modelled ICS20 like this, it would require us to hold a lock on the account balance of the sender (at least the keys holding the
denom being sent) from the original send until the ACK. This would not interfere with any other processes,
but that user could not send tokens locally, stake those tokens, receive local tokens, or even properly query his balance (as it is undefined).

In some cases where the business logic is very complex and hard to model commutatively, and the keys under lock are only used by this one
sub-system (nothing universal like bank), this may be the best approach. However, it is very limiting and should be avoided if possible.

**Note** Unlike a typical DB, we cannot wait on a lock, as a transaction must be processed sequentially (and quickly).
Instead, we return an error on any transaction that cannot acquire a lock, pushing the responsibility to the client to retry later.
This also ensures we can never get deadlock (just very poor performance if we lock too much).

## Forcing Commutativity

Here we go beyond the well-defined theories presented above, and to my own suggestions to how to safely convert many types of business logic
into something commutative. If a reader knows of some theory that explains the (in)correctness of such a scheme, it would be helpful
to expand the basis of this knowledge and a PR would be most welcome.

The basic concept is that to avoid conflicts, we do not need to make all possible operations commutative, but rather just guarantee that
**all concurrent operations** are commutative. This is a much weaker requirement, and can be achieved in many cases not by modifying the
data structures, but by aborting any transaction in the first phase (before IBC packet send), if it is not fully commutative with
all operations that are currently in-flight. That means, other operations that have previously sent an IBC packet and not yet received an ACK.
Furthermore, if the state transitions involved are local to one or two contracts, we only have to provide checks on those contracts,
which makes this a manageable task.

Note that is this not a general approach in most distributed systems, where we have a multi-writer scenario, and no ability to enforce
some global invariants before initiating a transaction. However, since all changes to the given data is initiated in the provider
blockchain, and we have a complete view of currently in-flight transactions, this approach could work for IBC protocols.

We can say that ICS20 implementation does something like this. As the only invariant is that the value never goes below zero,
it preemptively moves the tokens out of the users account to an escrow. This doesn't require any further lock on the user's account,
but ensures no other transaction will be possible to execute that would render the user's balance below 0 if this was committed.
Thus, any other transaction that would be commutative with this (commit or rollback) can be executed concurrently, but any other
transaction that would conflict with this (e.g. spend the same tokens, and only be valid if the ICS20 transfer gets an error ACK),
will immediately fail.

ICS20 is an extremely simple case, and you don't need such theory to describe decrementing one counter. However, assume there was not
only a min token balance (0) but some max, say 1 million. Then ICS20 would not work, as you could escrow 500k tokens, then receive
600k tokens, and if the ICS20 received an error ACK, it would be impossible to validly roll this back (another example of non-commutative,
or conflicting, operations).

### Value range

One idea to implement this would be to not just store one value (the balance), but a range of values, covering possible values if
all in-flight transactions were to succeed or fail. Normal transactions (send 100 tokens) would update both values and error if either
one violated some invariant (too high or too low). When an IBC transaction is initiated, it would execute eg. "Maybe(200)", which would
attempt to decrease the min by 200 but leave the max unchanged (requiring this range to remain valid). When the IBC ACK is received,
we would either `Commit(200)` or `Rollback(200)`, which would once again bring min and max to the same value (which one depends on Commit or Rollback).

This approach would only work by values not used by complex formulas, such as balances of an AMM (we can't calculate prices of ranges),
or paying out staking rewards (the value received by all other users depends on your stake, and we can't propagate this to all those accounts,
as it would be prohibitively expensive to collapse them all when the transaction is committed or rolled-back).

But for counters with comparisons, increments, and decrements, it could work well. Even enforcing logic like
"total amount of collateral is greater than the max lien amount" could be enforced if collateral and lien amounts
were value ranges. In this case, the max of (`lien.max`) would be compared against `collateral.min`.
With some clever reasoning, we could possibly enforce such value ranges without actually storing multiple fields.

Value ranges work when all operations (add and subtract) are commutative within a range, as they will only error on a boundary condition.
If we can guarantee that all outstanding transactions will in no case hit a boundary condition, then they are commutative,
and can be freely applied in any order.

If it may be possible to hit these (min or max) boundaries, then it is unsafe to perform them concurrently, and we must
fall back to another approach. Either [Locking](#locking), or returning an error on the offending transaction.

Value range tracks the possible range when resolving all outstanding transactions as either commit (success) or rollback (failure),
and can be checked against boundary conditions **before** adding a new transaction to the set of pending transactions.

Please note that an offending transaction can succeed / be accepted later. When some or all of the outstanding transactions are resolved,
either as succeeding or failing, and the value range is updated accordingly, it may be possible to execute the transaction
that previously failed, because the updated value range (or single value) now allows it.

After discussions with other developers, we feel that Value Ranges could be a very valuable approach, offering the same
guarantees of commutativity as locking, but with much less impact on the user's experience. It doesn't require developers
to reason about every workflow, but rather, like the locking approach, enforces constraints in the data structures themselves.
This is much less error-prone, and the same data structures that would be affected by locking are the same ones that would
be affected by value ranges.

We will focus on Locking for MVP, and look forward to develop this further for the V1 release, with plenty of time to discuss the
various UX implications, as well as the best way to implement this.

## Next Steps

With this understanding, we can now start to design IBC applications that are safe and correct.
I will reference these theoretical concepts while defining a safe implementation of the Mesh Security control
protocol under the assumption of unordered channels.
